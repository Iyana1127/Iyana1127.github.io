<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Iyana Jones, a coder with a sharp mind and steady resolve, shaping the future at Elizabeth City State University, where I’ll earn my Computer Science degree in December 2025. My 3.40 GPA stands on the firm ground of Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and courses like Data Structures and Web Design. I’ve built websites, crafted digital flyers that boosted event crowds by 30%, and led teams through AI-driven security challenges at the DASSH 2025 Hackathon. From G.R. Little Library’s stacks to the VR lab at the Centers for Teaching and Learning, I’ve worked with purpose—coding, designing, leading.
My path is marked by the Dean’s List, Chancellor’s List, and a Cisco cybersecurity certification earned in 2024. At Ve-Stem, I researched and presented with clarity; at SECU, I built study plans with LittleBits Code Kit, blending tech with learning. I designed an app for low-income families at the HBCUFI Hackathon, my team’s pitch cutting through the noise. My GitHub holds my projects, proof of my craft. I seek software engineering and web development roles, not waiting for the future but building it, line by line, with grit and precision.</p>
